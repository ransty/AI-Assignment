//    Unfortunately, the enemy has become aware of the agent and has dispatched troops in the area. Your agent has
//    been given a map of the territory controlled by the enemy, in addition to the terrain map as in Question 1.
//    Analogous to the terrain, the map shows the strength of the enemyâ€™s presence at each location. The dimensions of
//    this map will be the same as that of the terrain map. All the strength indicators will be integers in the range [0,100]
//    (with 0 and 100 included).
